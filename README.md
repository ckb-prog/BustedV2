Busted Multi-Target ARP Spoofing & Traffic Capture

📌 Description

This script performs multi-target ARP spoofing and captures DNS and TLS handshake traffic on a local network. It is useful for network security analysis, penetration testing, and monitoring encrypted traffic destinations (e.g., websites visited by targets).

✨ Features

- Auto-detects network interface and router IP

- Enables IP forwarding and configures iptables for traffic forwarding

- Spoofs multiple targets simultaneously using arpspoof

- Captures DNS queries and TLS handshake SNI data using tshark

- Logs captured traffic to a file

⚙️ Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the script:
```
ip

tshark

arpspoof (from the dsniff package)

awk

sudo
```
- Installation (Debian-based Systems)
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install dsniff tshark net-tools -y
```
- Usage

- 1. Run the Script
```
sudo ./busted_multi_target.sh
```
⚠️ This script must be run as root (or using sudo).

- 2. Provide Target IPs

When prompted, enter one or more target IP addresses (separated by spaces), for example:

[*] Enter target IPs separated by spaces (e.g., 192.168.0.6 192.168.0.10):

After entering the IPs, the script will:✅ Enable packet forwarding✅ Start ARP spoofing✅ Begin capturing network traffic

- Stop the Script

Press CTRL + C to stop the script and restore network settings. The cleanup function will:

- Kill ARP spoofing processes

- Flush iptables rules

❌ Disable IP forwarding

- Output

Captured traffic is logged to:
```
busted_multi_target_advanced.log
```
Each entry includes a timestamp, target IP, and domain name from TLS handshakes or DNS queries.

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only.❌ Unauthorized use on networks without explicit permission is illegal and may result in legal consequences.💡 Always obtain proper authorization before using this tool.

- Future Improvements

✅ Add automatic detection of all devices on the network✅ Implement support for MitM proxying✅ Improve output formatting
