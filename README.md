Busted Multi-Target ARP Spoofing & Traffic Capture

📌 Description

This script performs multi-target ARP spoofing and captures DNS and TLS handshake traffic on a local network. It is useful for network security analysis, penetration testing, and monitoring encrypted traffic destinations (e.g., websites visited by targets).

✨ Features

🔍 Auto-detects network interface and router IP

🚀 Enables IP forwarding and configures iptables for traffic forwarding

🎯 Spoofs multiple targets simultaneously using arpspoof

📡 Captures DNS queries and TLS handshake SNI data using tshark

📝 Logs captured traffic to a file

⚙️ Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the script:

ip

tshark

arpspoof (from the dsniff package)

awk

sudo

🛠 Installation (Debian-based Systems)

sudo apt update && sudo apt install dsniff tshark net-tools -y

🚀 Usage

1️⃣ Run the Script

sudo ./busted_multi_target.sh

⚠️ This script must be run as root (or using sudo).

2️⃣ Provide Target IPs

When prompted, enter one or more target IP addresses (separated by spaces), for example:

[*] Enter target IPs separated by spaces (e.g., 192.168.0.6 192.168.0.10):

After entering the IPs, the script will:✅ Enable packet forwarding✅ Start ARP spoofing✅ Begin capturing network traffic

3️⃣ Stop the Script

Press CTRL + C to stop the script and restore network settings. The cleanup function will:

🚫 Kill ARP spoofing processes

🔄 Flush iptables rules

❌ Disable IP forwarding

📂 Output

Captured traffic is logged to:

busted_multi_target_advanced.log

Each entry includes a timestamp, target IP, and domain name from TLS handshakes or DNS queries.

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only.❌ Unauthorized use on networks without explicit permission is illegal and may result in legal consequences.💡 Always obtain proper authorization before using this tool.

🏗 Future Improvements

✅ Add automatic detection of all devices on the network✅ Implement support for MitM proxying✅ Improve output formatting
